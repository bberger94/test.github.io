__Overall Effectiveness 4.38/5__ (Weighted sum of 3 sections)

Selected feedback:
* _Ben explained topics very clearly and brought positive energy to a challenging course, especially with R._
* _Ben always made himself available and was very knowledgeable. While other TAs in other courses would only assist during formal office hours, I could reach out to Ben ... whenever and time would be made._
* _I think the openness to reâ€“evaluate the course of the review session was an outstanding strength of Ben because thanks to his openness, the review sessions became more and more efficient over time. He was also always open to questions and made sure we understood everything before moving on to the next question._
