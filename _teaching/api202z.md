__Spring 2022: Overall Effectiveness 4.85/5__

Selected feedback:
* _...[Y]ou've struck gold with Ben! I found the review section notes and slides exceptional --- even if we couldnt get through all the content in the time with Ben, he made sure to focus on the things we were struggling with and still make good pace through the slides and then direct us to anything we didn't have time for._


__Spring 2021: Overall Effectiveness 4.61/5__

Selected feedback:
* _I can’t believe this is Ben’s first time teaching — he’s incredibly good at it
and I hope he continues for a long time!_
* _Ben is wonderful — he is so helpful and takes a lot of time to make sure that you understand
difficult concepts and that he answers questions clearly and comprehensively._
