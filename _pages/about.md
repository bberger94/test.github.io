I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy at Harvard University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. My research focuses on how public policy shapes the development and use of innovative health care technologies. 

In my <a href="https://ben-berger.com/papers/bberger_jmp.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','Download','PDF',this.href]);">job market paper</a>, I study how hospitals heterogeneously game the 340B Drug Pricing Program — a federal program intended to help hospitals that treat low-income patients — by leveraging health system integration to manipulate billing practices and thereby pass drug discounts on to care performed at other facilities.

Prior to attending Harvard, I worked as a research assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research. I received a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics from the University of Miami in 2016 (_magna cum laude_).

I am on the 2023-24 job market.
