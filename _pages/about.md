I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Policy at Harvard University and a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org). My research focuses on how public policy shapes the development and use of innovative health care technologies.

Prior to attending Harvard, I worked as a research assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research. I received a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics from the University of Miami in 2016 (_magna cum laude_).

I am on the 2023-24 job market.
