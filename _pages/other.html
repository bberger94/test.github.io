In my free time I like to take photos, both digital and film.

<style>
.photo{
    margin: 30px 0px 30px 0px;
}
</style>

<div align="center">
    <div class=photo>
        <img src="../images/photos/porter.png" width = "400" />
        <br> Porter Square at sunset.
    </div>
    <div class=photo>
        <img src="../images/photos/boston.jpg" width = "400" />
        <br> Boston skyline.
    </div>
    <div class=photo>
        <img src="../images/photos/bike.png" width = "400" />
        <br> Slick bike.
    </div>
    <div class=photo>
        <img src="../images/photos/mt_auburn.jpg" width = "400" />
        <br> Mt. Auburn Cemetery.
    </div>
</div>



I also maintain a 360-card Magic: The Gathering cube --- basically a bunch of trading cards that can be drafted, assembled into decks, and played on short notice. Check out my <a href="https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/v89">list!</a>
