abstract: "How does integration influence how health care providers respond to incentives? Reforming health care delivery is crucial for improving health outcomes and reducing costs, but because a majority of hospitals belong to integrated health systems, understanding how coordination between health care providers influences hospital policy responses is critical for crafting health care reform. In this paper, I consider how health systems influence providers’ responses to input price regulation by evaluating how the 340B Drug Pricing Program — which requires drug makers to sell discounted drugs to select hospitals — heterogeneously impacted the hospitalization of medical oncology. Using a staggered adoption design, I find that 340B increased hospitals’ Medicare spending on cancer drugs by an average of $200,000 per year. The increase was entirely driven by health system-affiliated hospitals, which significantly increased infusions and spending. The 340B program modestly increased system hospitals’ employment of medical oncologists but disproportionately increased hospital-based infusions attended by historically high-volume medical oncologists. System hospitals did not employ more radiation or surgical oncologists and generally did not increase use of other cancer treatments. I posit that system hospitals increased cancer drug administration primarily by deepening integration with already-affiliated medical oncologists, particularly those with extensive referral networks. Ultimately, integrated health systems may be especially well poised to game policies that give cost advantages to particular types of providers."
