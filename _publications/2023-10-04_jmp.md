abstract: "Many government programs are designed to transfer resources to
disadvantaged people and organizations that provide public services, but
these programs often inadvertently create incentives for agents to
exploit their provisions. Assessing how agents differentially game
programs is essential to understand their incidence and to correct
market distortions. In this paper, I study heterogeneous gaming of
public programs by evaluating how the 340B Drug Pricing Program — a
federal program intended to help hospitals that treat low-income
patients by requiring drug makers to sell discounted drugs to
participating hospitals — differentially impacted hospitals' billing
of infused cancer drugs. Using a staggered adoption design, I find that
340B increased hospitals' Medicare spending on cancer drugs by an
average of $200,000 per year. Remarkably, this increase was entirely
driven by health system-affiliated hospitals. The 340B program modestly
increased system hospitals' employment of medical oncologists but
disproportionately increased hospital-based infusions attended by
historically high-volume medical oncologists. Other aspects of cancer
care remained the same, suggesting quality competition for physicians
and patients was not an important channel for hospitals to increase
care. I posit that health systems responded to 340B primarily by billing
outpatient facilities as hospital departments to qualify those
facilities for drug discounts. This analysis suggests that
characteristics inherent to health systems facilitate gaming of public
programs but resulting distortions may be substantially mitigated by
regulation of billing practices."
