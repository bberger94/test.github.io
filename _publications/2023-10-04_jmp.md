abstract: "Many government programs are designed to transfer resources to
disadvantaged people and organizations that provide public services, but
these programs often inadvertently create incentives for agents to
exploit their provisions. Assessing how agents differentially game
programs is essential to understand their incidence and correct market
distortions. In this paper, I study how hospitals heterogeneously gamed
the 340B Drug Pricing Program â€” a federal program intended to aid
providers that treat low-income patients by requiring drug makers to
sell drugs to participants at steep discounts. I focus on the role of
health systems, which coordinate the business functions of numerous
providers and may thereby facilitate passing 340B discounts on to drugs
administered outside hospital walls. Using a staggered adoption design,
I find that 340B increased hospitals' Medicare spending on cancer drugs
by an average of $200,000 per year. Remarkably, this increase was
entirely driven by health system-affiliated hospitals, which increased
infusions by 72 percent. System hospitals increased medical oncologist
employment only modestly, indicating that 340B did not lead hospitals to
forge many new relationships with physicians through practice
acquisitions. System hospitals also did not increase cancer screening or
adopt new non-medical cancer treatments, indicating little effort to
attract new patients. Instead, my analysis suggests that health systems
necessarily have advantages in gaming programs like 340B, but resulting
distortions may be substantially mitigated by regulation of billing
practices."
